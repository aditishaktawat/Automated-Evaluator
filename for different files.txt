AES ASAP dataset ( ASAP - Automated Student Assessment Prize ) from kaggle , this was mainly used for a competition held 12 years ago
It consists of 13000 essays (student answers) with human score.

And the second one we made for trying and checking cosine similarity matching and word movers distance for score prediction
It consists of 9 student answers with ideal solutions for evaluation

coding files
for cosine and word movers distance - cosinewmd.ipynb   ( used the dataset made my own ) 
for machine learning -
linear reggresion , support vector machine and random forest - main.ipynb   ( used ASAP dataset )
various different trials etc present can be deleted or can we used with proper dataset for good working.
