IoT devices should be tested thoroughly and updated as soon as new vulnerabilities are identified to maintain security and win customers' trust.\\n\\nLack of knowledge and awareness: IoT is a very new and growing technology, so; people do not have proper knowledge or awareness about these devices. It may also act as a security threat to users' confidentiality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

       "Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interconnected objects, usually called smart devices, through the Internet. The object can be a heart monitor, a remote, or an automobile with built-in sensors. That is objects that have been assigned an IP address and have the capability to collect and transfer data over a network. The objects interact with the external environment with the help of embedded technology, which helps them in taking decisions.

It is referred to as a network comprised of interconnected physical objects (referred to as \"things\") worldwide that are capable of collecting and exchanging data without human interaction. These devices contain embedded systems (software, electronics, networks, and sensors) that are able to collect data about the surrounding environment, transmit data over a network, respond to remote commands, or take actions based on data collected.

       "Sensors/Devices: Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. All this data may have various levels of complexities. It could be a simple temperature monitoring sensor, or it may be in the form of the video feed.\\nConnectivity: All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communications. These communication mediums include mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc.\\nData Processing: Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software product performs processing on the gathered data. This process can be just checking the temperature, reading on devices like AC or heaters. However, it can sometimes also be very complex, like identifying objects, using computer vision on video.\\nUser Interface: The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way, which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notification through email or text message. The user sometimes might need an interface which actively checks their IoT system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Sensors/Devices\\nFirst, sensors or devices help in collecting very minute data from the surrounding environment. All of this collected data can have various degrees of complexities ranging from a simple temperature monitoring sensor or a complex full video feed.\\n\\nA device can have multiple sensors that can bundle together to do more than just sense things. For example, our phone is a device that has multiple sensors such as GPS, accelerometer, camera but our phone does not simply sense things.\\n\\nThe most rudimentary step will always remain to pick and collect data from the surrounding environment be it a standalone sensor or multiple devices. Connectivity\\nNext, that collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure but it needs a medium for transport.\\n\\nThe sensors can be connected to the cloud through various mediums of communication and transports such as cellular networks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, wide-area networks (WAN), low power wide area network and many more.\\n\\nEvery option we choose has some specifications and trade-offs between power consumption, range, and bandwidth. So, choosing the best connectivity option in the IOT system is important. Data Processing\\nOnce the data is collected and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the acquired data.\\n\\nThis can range from something very simple, such as checking that the temperature reading on devices such as AC or heaters is within an acceptable range. It can sometimes also be very complex, such as identifying objects (such as intruders in your house) using computer vision on video.\\n\\nBut there might be a situation when a user interaction is required, example- what if when the temperature is too high or if there is an intruder in your house? Thatâs where the user comes into the picture.  User Interface\\nNext, the information made available to the end-user in some way. This can achieve by triggering alarms on their phones or notifying through texts or emails.\\n\\nAlso, a user sometimes might also have an interface through which they can actively check in on their IOT system. For example, a user has a camera installed in his house, he might want to check the video recordings and all the feeds through a web server.\\n\\nHowever, itâs not always this easy and a one-way street. Depending on the IoT application and complexity of the system, the user may also be able to perform an action that may backfire and affect the system.    1\n",

The nature of this data can vary. This could be as simple as your phone having a temperature sensor, GPS, an accelerometer, or as complex as a live video feature on a social media platform. Sensors make it possible for IoT devices to connect to the real world and environment.\\nConnectivity: Upon collection, all data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. This could be done by connecting the sensors to the cloud using a variety of communication mediums such as mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc. Various IoT devices use different types of connectivity.\\nData Processing: Once the data has been collected, and has reached the cloud, it is the responsibility of the data processors to process it. Data processing software can enhance IoT devices in a wide range of ways, from adjusting the temperature of the air conditioner to recognizing faces on mobile phones.\\nUser Interface: An IoT device interacts with a user through a User Interface. A user interface is the visible, tangible component of an IoT system that can be accessed by users. It involves presenting the information in a way that is valuable to the end-user. A well-designed user interface will simplify the experience for users and encourage them to interact more. Information needs to be made accessible to end-users in some way, like sending them alerts via notification, email or text message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

Sensors collect data from the environment and give to gateway where as actuators performs the action (as directed after processing of data). \\n \\nGateway \\nThe sensors give data to Gateway and here some kind of pre-processing of data is even done. It also acts as a level of security for the network and for the transmitted data. \\n \\nCloud \\nThe data after being collected is uploaded to cloud. Cloud in simple terms is basically a set of servers connected to internet 24*7. \\n \\nAnalytics \\nThe data after being received in the cloud processing is done . Various algorithms are applied here for proper analysis of data (techniques like Machine Learning etc are even applied). \\n \\nUser Interface \\nUser end application where user can monitor or control the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
